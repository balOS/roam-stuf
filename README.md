# roam-stuf
a collection of roam plugins, snippets + workflow design

i've been building roam/JS plugins for the past few months, and some have proven very valuable for my brain.

these are all designed for me, but i imagine they will have value when adapted to your tags. 

first up - **prompt me**
- randomly generate blocks from 2 tags + prompt to write a new note

why? 
i write a billion notes + need to resurface thoughts that would get lost otherwise. [[misfits]]
i need to practice concision + clarity.
the act of combination helps create [[evergreen]] notes. a simple generative brain hack.
i never publish content even though i create tons. [[find your people]]

how to use
- create a new block with {{[[roam/js]]}} 
- copy the roam/JS snippet and paste into an indented block
- within the code block, change the tags in question [[My Best Ideas]] and [[writing]] to fit two tags you are interested in comparing. 
- hit play
- review your saved text on the [[prompt me]] page. add your own [[evergreen]] tag to auto compile. 

have fun.
